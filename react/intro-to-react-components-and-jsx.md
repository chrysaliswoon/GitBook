# Intro To React, Components and JSX

## What is React?

It is a **JS library** created by **Facebook** for building fast and interactive User Interface (UI).

At the centre of all react applications are **components**, which is a **piece of the user interface,** so when building applications with react, we build a **bunch of independent, isolated and reusable components** and compose them to build complex UI.

Think of a component as a single lego block. These blocks/components are integrated together to **build a bigger and more dynamic application**.&#x20;

The biggest advantage of using components is you can **change any component at any point in time** without affecting the rest of the applications.

## Why Choose React?

There are various reasons why one might choose React, and here are a few:

* Fast
  * Apps made in React can handle complex updates, yet feel quick and responsive.
* Modular
  * You can write smaller, reusable files which is a great solution to JS [maintainability problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti\_code).
* Scalable
  * React is great for programs that display a lot of changing data.
* Flexible
* Popular

## React in MVC

The MVC architecture is a JS design pattern for building applications.&#x20;

* M - Model
  * Database
* V - Views
  * Presentation Layer: What the user sees and interacts with the browser
* C - Controller
  * Makes decisions based on requests and controls what happens in response, like clicking on links and submitting forms.

### Virtual DOM For Efficiency

The `Document Object Model` or _DOM_ for short is an API that is used to interact with the HTML that is displayed on a page.&#x20;

![DOM Structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210908120846/DOM.png)

The Virtual DOM is a representation of the actual _DOM_ and is a staging area for changes that will eventually be implemented. Because of that, React can keep track of changes in the actual _DOM_ by comparing different instances of the Virtual DOM.

React then isolates the changes between old and new instances of the Virtual DOM and then only updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes as opposed to re-rendering an entire view altogether which is significantly more efficient.
