# Introduction To React

### Rise & Fall of jQuery

jQuery was the tool of choice for front-end developers but it's now starting to run its course and is being replaced by libraries that fall into the category of **framework**.

The biggest difference that separates jQuery and another library like React is the use virtual-DOM. While jQuery directly interacts with the DOM to manipulate elements, react uses a specialised virtual-dom.

### List of Front-end Frameworks

Several years after the birth of jQuery several front end frameworks were introduced that provided a much more structured and opinionated way of writing code.

### What is React?

It is a **JS library** created by **Facebook** for building fast and interactive User Interface (UI).

### Difference between Libraries & Framework

* **Library**: A set of code that was previously written, that can be called upon when building your own code.&#x20;
  * Analogy = Think of it as a box of individual Lego bricks which you can use to construct something.
* **Framework**: Supporting structure where your own code defines the "meat" of the operations by filling out the structure. It helps to standardise your code, give additional functionality, performance and can get your code off the ground faster.&#x20;
  * Analogy = If a Library is individual Lego bricks which you can use, a Framework is the manual which you can follow to create a structure, like a Lego castle for instance.
* Some popular front-end frameworks are:
  * React
  * Vue
  * Angular
  * Ember

### Why Choose React?

There are various reasons why one might choose React, and here are a few:

* **Fast** - Apps made in React can handle complex updates, yet feel quick and responsive.
* **Modular** - You can write smaller, reusable files which is a great solution to JS [maintainability problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti\_code).
* **Scalable** - React is great for programs that display a lot of changing data.
* **Flexible** - You can us to create interesting projects that isn't a web app.
* **Popular** - Many companies use React

React was born out of Facebook's frustration with the traditional MVC model and:

* how re-rendering something meant re-rendering **everything** (or just a lot).
* how it had negative implications on processing power and ultimately user experience, which at times became glitchy and lagging.

### React in MVC

The MVC architecture is a JS design pattern for building applications.

![MVC Model](https://rangleio.ghost.io/content/images/2021/04/mvc\_blog\_diagrams\_MVC\_pattern1.png)

* M - Model
  * Database
* V - Views
  * Presentation Layer: What the user sees and interacts with the browser
* C - Controller
  * Makes decisions based on requests and controls what happens in response, like clicking on links and submitting forms.

### Virtual DOM For Efficiency

The `Document Object Model` or _DOM_ for short is an API that is used to interact with the HTML that is displayed on a page.

![DOM Structure](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20210908120846/DOM.png)

The Virtual DOM is a representation of the actual _DOM_ object, like a lightweight copy.

It has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's power to directly change what's on the screen.&#x20;

Manipulating the DOM is slow, and it is faster to manipulate the virtual DOM as nothing gets drawn onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms in an actual house.

When you render a JSX element, every single virtual DOM object gets updated. Because of that, React can keep track of changes in the actual _DOM_ by comparing different instances of the Virtual DOM.

![Compare Virtual and Real DOM](https://i.imgur.com/xTxgF0b.png)

React then isolates the changes between old and new instances of the Virtual DOM and then only updates the actual DOM with the necessary changes as opposed to re-rendering an entire view altogether which is significantly more efficient. This process is called **"diffing"**.

Once React knows which virtual DOM objects have changed, it updates only those objects, on the real DOM. This means that if you render the same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing:

```
const hello = <h1>Hello world</h1>;
 
// This will add "Hello world" to the screen:
ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));
 
// This won't do anything at all:
ReactDOM.render(hello, document.getElementById('app'));
```

In summary, here‚Äôs what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

1. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2. The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
3. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the _real_ DOM.
4. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.

### Get Started with React

#### ****![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)**CODING TIME**&#x20;

#### Install the required dependencies (libraries)

* Create the following code in **`index.html`**
* Importing the libraries into **`index.js`**

{% code title="index.html" %}
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>First React</title>
  
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
  <!-- Make sure your index.js is below the 2 react scripts -->
  <script defer src="index.js"></script>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>First React</h1>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>
</html>
```
{% endcode %}

_Note: Ensure that the React version is React 17 as of `16.8` React introduced `Hooks` which has changed that way we write React Components and we will use `Hooks` for the curriculum._

**ReactDOM.render()**

* Using **`ReactDOM.render()`** to render our initial content.

With our libraries in place we can use `ReactDOM.render()` to render either, a `Component` or `HTML` to the screen, in our basic starter app we will render some basic `HTML` for now.

{% code title="index.js" %}
```
// GRAB THE ELEMENT WITH AN ID OF ROOT AND STORE IN A VARIABLE CALLED rootElement
const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

const element = React.createElement("h1", { children: "Hello World" });
console.log(element);

// USE ReactDOM TO RENDER SOME HTML
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"));;
```
{% endcode %}

This is what you should see:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-01-23 at 6.37.58 PM.png>)

We only have to use `ReactDOM.render()` once when `mounting` React to our html. For every React app we build going forward this step will already have been completed for us and so we will never need to do this manually again.
